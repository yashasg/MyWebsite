                    Hi!! I am Suwas Walve. I have worked as a Game Engineer / Designer in more than 10 Game Projects. I have played the role of a Lead Engineer, AI Engineer, UI Engineer, Gameplay Engineer and Level Designer in many of them. Apart from my programming skills I am proficient in Maths and Physics as well. I love to contribute to the Art, Design, Production and Marketing part of Game Development. I am more passionate about developing games than playing them.
                    I am currently a graduate student at the University of Utah, pursuing Masters degree in Entertainment Arts and Engineering program which is the #1 graduate game development program in the U.S. I am currently making a Game Engine using C++. Being a Photoshop Expert and being able to use other 3D modelling softwares as well, I love working with Artists.
